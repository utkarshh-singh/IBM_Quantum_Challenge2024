# IBM Quantum Challenge 2024

Welcome to my repository for the **IBM Quantum Challenge 2024**! This repository contains my solutions and contributions as both a participant and mentor in the challenge.

## Overview

The **IBM Quantum Challenge 2024** was an exceptional event, marking the largest IBM quantum challenge to date with around **5000 participants**. This year **IBM** also introduced Qiskit 1.0, the first stable release of the Qiskit SDK, which supports utility-scale quantum computation. This challenge was focused on leveraging Qiskit 1.0 for various quantum computational tasks, catering to both beginners and experienced quantum enthusiasts.

### Key Highlights

- **Participant and Mentor**: Actively participated and provided mentorship for the first time.
- **Completed All Challenges**: Successfully completed all the main challenges as well as the bonus challenge.
- **Qiskit 1.0**: Implemented new features of Qiskit 1.0, focused on utility-scale experiments with over 100 qubits and integrated AI capabilities with IBM watsonx™.

## About the Challenge

This year’s challenge was structured into a series of Jupyter notebooks, or "labs," designed to guide participants through the fundamentals and advanced topics of Qiskit. The labs included:
- **Tutorial Material**: Educational content for newcomers to learn about quantum computing and Qiskit.
- **Code Examples**: Practical examples to understand quantum concepts.
- **Auto-Graded Coding Challenges**: Interactive coding problems to apply the learned concepts.

The challenge not only covered the basics of quantum computing but also highlighted the capabilities of **Qiskit 1.0**, including:
- **New Integrations**: Enhanced features for quantum experiments and AI integration.
- **Utility-Scale Quantum Computing**: Demonstrated what it means to work with utility-scale quantum experiments, targeting those with 100 or more qubits.
